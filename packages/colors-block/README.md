# Color Block

This block can be used to create a color palette. The created palette can then be used in other blocks where color palette selection is available.

Block's name can be changed as well as its description.
The user is able to select multiple color spaces which represent the type of colors inside the palette.
Each color's name can be changed. On hover, the color can be copied to the clipboard for easier future usage.
