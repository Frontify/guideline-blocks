# Checklist Block

This block can be used to create a checklist with customizable text styles, checkbox color & decoration.
An optional progress bar can also be displayed if there are 1 or more active items in the list.

The list can be sorted by editors by dragging and dropping, or by navigating using the control buttons inside the checklist item.
The list can also be navigated through the keyboard with the use of the arrow keys to iterate to the next focusable element.
